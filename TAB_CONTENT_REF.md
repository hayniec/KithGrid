# Tab Content Implementation

Due to the large size of the complete implementation, I'm creating this as a reference document.

## Tab 1: Community Info

Contains:
- HOA Contact Information
- Dues Information  
- Board Officers (with contact buttons)
- Community Amenities

## Tab 2: Rules & Guidelines

Contains:
- Property Maintenance rules
- Parking & Vehicles rules
- Pet policies
- Noise & Nuisance policies

## Tab 3: Service Providers

Contains:
- Landscaping vendor
- Pool Maintenance vendor
- Security vendor
- Property Management vendor

## Tab 4: Documents & Resources

Contains:
- Upload button (for admins)
- Document list with categories
- Download links

## Implementation Strategy

Since the file is getting very large (500+ lines), I'll implement the tab content in a single comprehensive replacement to avoid multiple edits.
